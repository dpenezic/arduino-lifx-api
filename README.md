# Arduino-Lifx-API
A library that serves as a wrapper for the [Lifx HTTP API](https://api.developer.lifx.com/docs)
You can read more about it here: http://www.joeybabcock.me/blog/projects/arduino-lifx-api-control-library-for-esp8266/

It requires the [ArduinoJson Library](https://github.com/bblanchon/ArduinoJson)

As of right now all it can really do is display the bulb stats, stuff like is it on, color, name, brightness.
