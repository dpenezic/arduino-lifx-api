You can read more about it here: http://www.joeybabcock.me/blog/projects/arduino-lifx-api-control-library-for-esp8266/

It requires the [ArduinoJson Library](https://github.com/bblanchon/ArduinoJson)

It can query the status of the bulb to find things like color/brightness/hue, as well as toggle the power.
